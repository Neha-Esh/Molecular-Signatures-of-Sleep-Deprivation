# Sleep Deprivation Transcriptomic Analysis

## Project Overview

This repository contains a computational analysis pipeline for studying gene expression changes associated with sleep deprivation using publicly available GEO microarray data.

The workflow includes:

- Data preprocessing and quality control
- Normalization and transformation
- Differential gene expression analysis
- Statistical filtering with FDR correction
- Machine learning classification
- Integrated downstream biological analysis
- Functional enrichment exploration

All analyses are implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebooks.
